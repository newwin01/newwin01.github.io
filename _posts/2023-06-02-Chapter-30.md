Condition Variables

- Checking whether a condition is true before continuing its execution
    - If the parent thread might wish to check whether a child thread has been completed before continuing
- Waiting for a condition to become true → condition variable
    - Explicit queue that threads can put themselves on when some state of execution is not as desired
    - When the state has been changed, then wake one of those on the waiting queue
    - Wait
        - release the lock and put the calling thread to sleep
        - Wakes up, re-acquire the lock before returning to the caller
    - The parent continues running itself and thus immediately calls into thr_join()
        - Need to check the child is done and put itself to sleep by calling wait
    - The child runs immediately upon creating, sets done to 1, calls a signal to wake a sleeping thread, and is done. The parent then runs, calls thr_join(), done is 1 already, so does not wait for anything
    - No state variable
        - State variable done → records the value the threads are interested in knowing
        - If there is no thread asleep on the condition → if parent calls wait and no thread can be woke up
    - Race condition
        - No lock
        - Parent check the  value of done and set to 0 → Before it calls wait to go to sleep, interrupt
        - Child runs → child change the state variable as 1 and interrupt(signal)
        - no thread is waiting, parent is sleeping forever
    - Producer/Consumer
        - Bounded - buffer
            - Shared resources require synchronized access
        - Producer thread
        - Consumer thread
        - On the multiple threads
            - The state of the bounded buffer changed because of different buffer
            - Mesa semantics
                - no guarantee that when the woken thread runs, the state will still be as desired
                - first research that built a condition variable in such a manner
            - Hoare semantics
                - harder to build but provides a stronger guarantee that the woken thread will run immediately upon being woken
    - While
        - Always use while loops
        - When two consumer run first
            - Both realize the buffer is empty → sleep
            - Produce fill the buffer and wakes the one of consumer
            - Consumer wakes, rechecks the condition, the buffer is full, consumes, then need to wake the producer → how?
            - Signaling is clearly needed
    - Clear signal
        - use two condition variables, instead of one, in order to properly signal which type of thread should wake up when the state of the system changes
        - Example
            - Empty condition
            - Full condition
            - Producer wait on the condition empty, signal fills
            - Consumer wait on fil and signal empty
        - More buffer slots
            - Multiple value can be produced, consumed before sleeping
            - Using put and get
            - A producer only sleeps if all buffers are currently filled
            - A consumer only sleeps if all buffers are currently empty
    - Covering Conditions
        - Wake all waiting threads
            - threads will simply wake up, re-check the condition, and then go immediately back to sleep
            - it covers all the cases where a thread needs to wake up
        - It might be better for certain case
