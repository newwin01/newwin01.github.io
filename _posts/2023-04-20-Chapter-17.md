Free-Space Management

When free-space management becomes more difficult is when the free space with user-level memory-allocation memory

- Segmentation
- External Fragmentation
- Internal fragmentation
    - if an allocator hands out chunks of memory bigger than that requested, any unasked for (and thus unused) space in such a chunk
- void pointer
- Low-level Mechanisms
    - Splitting and Coalescing
        - requesting more than space that is free will fail → splitting
        - will find a free chunk of memory that can satisfy request
        - What if returned space is in the middle of heap?
        - It may end up with divided arrays with continuous size
    - Tracking the size of allocated regions
        - header block
        - Embedding Free list
        - mmap
        - Fragmented free spaces
            - go through the list and merge neighboring chunks
        - Heap can grow heap
            - OS finds free physical pages, maps them into the address space of the requesting process, then returns the value of the end of the new heap
- Strategies
    - Best fit → search through the free list and find chunks of free memory that bigger than the request size then return one that is the smallest in that group of candidate
    - Worst fit → case find the largest chunk and return the requested amount
    - First fit → finds the first block that is big enough and returns the requested amount to the user
        - May pollute the beginning of the free list with a small objects
        - address-based ordering → keeping the list ordered by the address of free space
    - Net fit → keeps an extra pointer to the location within the list where one was looking last
        - Spread the search for free space throughout the list more uniformly, thus avoiding splintering of the beginning of the list
- Segregated List
    - Slab allocator
        - The basic idea is simple: if a particular application has one (or a few) popular-sized requests that it makes, keep a separate list just to manage objects of that size
    - Slab allocator
        - Specifically, when the kernel boots up, it allocates a number of object caches for kernel objects that are likely to be requested frequently
- Buddy allocation
    - big space of size 2^N
    - search for free space recursively divides free space by two until a block that is big enough to accommodate the request is found
    - may suffer internal fragmentation
    - When returning the 8KB block to the free list, the allocator checks whether the “buddy” 8KB is free; if so, it coalesces the two blocks into a 16KB block.
- One major problem with many of the approaches described above is their lack of scaling.
