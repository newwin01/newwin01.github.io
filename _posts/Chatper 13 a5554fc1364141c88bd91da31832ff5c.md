The abstraction: Address Space

- Early Systems
    - OS was a set of routines that sat in memory
    - Use the set of the memory
    - Multiprogramming and Time Sharing
        - Multiprogramming
        - Utilization
        - Efficiency
        - Time Sharing
        - Interactivity
        - Protection
    - The address space
        - easy to use abstract of physical memory
        - code
            - have to live in memory somewhere
        - stack
            - keep track of where it is in the function call chain
            - grow upward
        - heap
            - dynamic allocating memory
            - grows downward
        - The whole thing is just a convention
        - By putting stack and heap opposite, hopefully, grow well
        - What if Multiple threads co-exists â†’ abstraction required
    - Virtualizing Memory
        - Transparency
            - Program should not be aware of the fact that memory is virtualized
            - OS does works to multiplex memory
        - Efficiency
            - OS strive to make the virtualization as efficient as possible
            - Both time and space
            - rely on hardware
        - Protection
            - make sure to protect processes from one another as well as the OS itself from processes
            - Property of isolation
    -
