# IPC

Signal

- There can be hardware interrupts, but software interrupts as well
- GNU signal can be a great reference.
    - Linux relies on GNU
- Signal API → type of interrupt, handler
- Signal1.c
    - function pointer → address of the program
    - handler has no return but one input value; signal input is given
    - Check signal is whether Sigint
    - ctrl + c → now task to the program from the outside
    - It changes the control flow of the operation
- Signal2.c
    - Alarm signal
    - need to handle regular alarm
    - Timer interrupt occurs by a sec
    - by signaling, preemption happens and context switch as well
- Pipe1.c
    - Nonzero value → error
    - pipe is a kind of file
        - File is anything that can have stream of information
    - Parent and child has same file description information
    - Pipe works for reading and writing
    - If the value is broken, make to write remaining data (buffer)
    - Writing behavior depends on OS/ return sent value, it is because it has limited space of buffer
    - No more data comes to the pipe
    - 3 is reading pipe, 4 is writing pipe
    - reading happens up to 31 characters
    - Child and parent process
    - Through using file, parent and child process exchange their data
    - It is something shared exclusively
        - Doesn’t have global name to be not interrupted by other processes.
        - For one to one communication
    - Unnamed pipe → use to make communicate
    - multiple process invoked at same time, it is to difficult to clarify sender and messages
        - Synchronization
- Pipe2.c
    - duplicate operation
    - hello program is loaded
    - standard ouput goes to the pipe
    - Hello is executed, sent to the pipe and show up at the display
    - invoke the program at the middle of the program
    - Library → popen (read how to utilizte the API)
        - File is pipe
        - execution results is given to file actually
