# Recommender System

- one of the most popular ML algorithms
    - can provide personalized service
- the recommendation can be applied to everywhere
- Given:
    - users
    - items
- Goal:
    - find relevance score
    - recommend most relevant items
- Issue
    - relevance â†’ context-dependent
    - tensor instead of a user-item matrix
- Content-based filtering
    - based on a description of the item and a profile of the user
- Collaborative filtering
    - based on community
- Pros and Cons

- Content-based filtering
    - we need
        - information about the items
        - some user profile describing what user likes
    - the task
        - user preference
        - recommend items that are similar to the user preference
    - Simple approach
        - compute the similarity of an unseen item with the user profile based on the keyword overlap
    - Standard measure
        - TFIDF
            - TF: measure how often a term appears
            - IDF: aims to reduce the weight of terms that appear in all documents

- Collaborative filtering
    - the most prominent approach to generating recommendations
    - used by large, commercial e-commerce sites
    - applicable in various fields
    - Approach
        - use the wisdom of crowd
    - Basic Assumption and Idea
        - users give ratings to catalog items
        - customers who had similar tastes in the past, will have similar tastes in the future
    - similarities in collaborative filtering
        - Jaccard distance
        - Cosine distance
        - Pearson correlation

- Latent factor apporach
    - users and items are represented in a continuous vector space
- matrix factorization methods
    - Singular Value Decomposition
    - non-negative matrix factorization
