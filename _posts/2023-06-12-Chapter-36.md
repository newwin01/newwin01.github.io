Input/output device (I/O)

- System Architecture
    - Hierarchiacal structure
        - CPU, memory, memory BUS
        - I/O bus
            - PCI
                - Peripheral Component Interconnect
                - High-speed I/O devices such as graphics
            - Peripheral bus
                - Lower speed bus
                - SATA, USB
                - connects to disks, mice, keyboards
        - Reasons
            - Physics, cost
            - a high-performance memory bus does not have much room to plug devices and such into it
    - Modern Computer system
        - DMI
            - Direct Media Interface
            - Devices connect to the chip
        - ATA → The AT Attachment
            - SATA, eSATA
        - USB
            - Universal Serial Bus → Keyborads, Mice
        - PCIe
            - Peripheral Component Interconnect Express
            - Higher performance → networ, NVMe(High speed)
    - Canonical Device
        - Hardware interface
            - present interface that allows the system software to control its operation
            - All device have specified interface and protocol
        - Internal structure
            - specific and responsible for implementin the abstraction the devide presents to the system
                - Simple device such as CPU, memroy, RAID controller
            - thousands of line of firmware
    - Canonical Protocol
        - Status register → current status
        - Command register → to perform certain task
        - Data register → pass data to device
        - Four steps
            - Pooling, waiting for the device is ready to receive a command
            - Sending data
                - Programmed I/O
            - Command using command register
            - OS waits for device poerform the task
    - Lowering CPU overhead
        - interrupt
            - Instead of pooling
            - Interrupt Service Routine
                - Interrupt Handler
            - Allows overlap of computation and I/O
        - using interrupts is not always the best solution
            - Interrupt is expensive, inefficient in the case of simple I/O interrupt
                - Hybrid, two-phased approach
                - First Poll
                - After certain time, interrupt
                - if a device is fast, it may be best to poll; if it is slow, interrupt
            - coalescing
                - device need to raise an interrupt first waits for a bit
                - multiple interrupts can be coalesced into a single interrupt delivery
    - More Efficient Data Movement With DMA
        - when using programmed I/O (PIO) to transfer a large chunk of data to a device, the CPU is once again over burdened with a rather trivial task
            - Copying the data using CPU → trivial task
        - Direct Memory Access (DMA)
            - OS program DMA engine by telling it where the data lives in memory, how much data to copy, and which device to send it to.
            - DMA is complete → raise the interrupt, and the OS knows the transfer control is completed
    - Methods Of Device Interaction
        - explicit I/O instructions
            - previleged instructions
            - OS controls device, directly communicate with the device
        - Memory mapped I/O
            - the hardware makes device registers available as if they were memory locations
            - OS issues a load (to read) or store (to write) the address
            - The memory-mapped approach is nice in that no new instructions are needed to support it
    - Device Driver
        - how to fit devices, each of which have very specific interfaces
        - OS must know in detail how a device work
            - Device Driver solve the question

        - 70% of OS code is found in device drivers
        - Window is high as well
    - An IDE disk presents a simple interface to the system, consisting of four types of register: control, command block, status, and error
        - Basic Protocol
            - Wait for ready
            - Write parameter to command register
            - Start I/O
            - Data transfer
            - Handle interrupts
            - Error Handling
    - Who started first?
        - Not clear
        - people built these early machines, it became obvious that I/O support was needed.
