Locks

- Lock variable
    - Calling lock → acquire the lock and enter the ciritical section
    - thre thread acquire the lock called the owner of the lock
    - Unlock → free the lock again
- Pthread locks
    - Mutex → mutual exclusion between threads
    - one thread is in the critical section, it excludes the others from entering until it has completed the section
    - we may be using different locks to protect different variables (fine-grained)
    - Mutual exclusion
    - Fairness
    - Performance
- Earliest solution → disable the interrupt
    - simple
    - need to perform a privileged operations
    - Monopolize processor
    - Different CPU → does not matter of disable interrupts, just go to other process
    - Inefficient
- Just using load and store
    - test flag is one and holds the lock
    - simply spin-wait
    - Problem
        - correctness
            - Both threads can be set to 1 and able to enter the ciritical section
        - performance
            - Spin-waiting waste the time
- Spin locks with Test and sets
    - test-and-set (or atomic exchange1) instruction
        - Dekker’s algorithm
        - Peterson’s algorithm
    - returns the old value pointed to by the old ptr, and simultaneously updates said value to new
    - Atomically operates
    - By making both the test (of the old lock value) and set (of the new value) a single atomic operation, we ensure that only one thread acquires the lock.
- Evaluating Spin Locks
    - Correctness → proved
    - Fairenss → no fairenss guarantee
    - Performance
        - Single CPU → performance overhead
        - Multiple CPUs → work well
- Compare-And-Swap
    - Or Compare-And-Exchange
    - The basic idea is for compare-and-swap to test whether the value at the address specified by ptr is equal to expected
    - simply checks if the flag is 0 and if so, atomically swaps in a 1 thus acquiring the lock
    - lock-free synchronization
- MIPS
    - load-linked and store-conditional instructions can be used in tandem to build locks and other concurrent structures
    - Load-linked
    - store-conditional, which only succeeds if no intervening store to the address taken the place

    - Fetch and add
        - ticket lock
        - uses a ticket and turn variable in combination to build a lock
        - does an atomic fetch-and-add on the ticket value
        - The globally shared lock->turn is then used to determine which thread’s turn it is
        - it ensures progress for all threads\
- Spinning
    - Waste of time slice doing nothing and check
    - Yield approach
        - we assume an operating system primitive yield()
        - thread can call when it wants to give up the CPU and let another thread run
        - move running to ready state → descheduling
        - But potential waste still
    - Sleeping instead of spinning
        - park() to put a calling thread to sleep
        - unpark(threadID) to wake a particular thread as designated by threadID
        - old test-and-set idea with an explicit queue of lock waiters
        - use a queue to help control who gets the lock next, thus avoiding starvation.
        - Add to queue that does not get the lock
            - calling the gettid() function
        - Release the guard after park()
            - flag does not get set back to 0 when another thread gets woken up
        - a thread will be about to park, assuming that it should sleep until the lock is no longer held
            - wakeup/waiting race
        - setpark(). By calling this routine, a thread can indicate it is about to park.
    - Priority inversion
        - If I/O keep occurs on no lock thread, just keep spinning and take the CPU cycle
        - a higher-priority thread waiting for a lower-priority thread → priority inheritance
- Different OS
    - futex
        - associated with it a specific physical memory location
        - futex_wait
        - futex_wake
- Two-Phase Lock
    - spinning can be useful, particularly if the lock is about to be released
    - Hybrid approach
        - First Spin phase → lock is not acquired → second phase: caller is put to sleep, wake when lock become frees
