## I am at the end of 3rd week in Handong. 
<br>

The 3rd and 1st semesters at Handong are called "사망년" because it is busy as "hell". <br>
And I am passing the 3rd week. This semester, there were lots of changes. I joined ISEL and met co-workers who share information and visions. <br>
I am getting familiar with the Linux system, started to use notion and slack, and start to learn query statements. 

<br> I am really happy to learn and I hope this happiness last at least until the end of this semester.
