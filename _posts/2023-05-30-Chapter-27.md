Thread API

- Thread Creation
    - thread → a pointer to a structure of type pthread_t
    - attribute → to specify any attributes this thread might have
    - function pointer → a function name (start routine), which is passed a single argument of type void * (as indicated in the parentheses after start routine), and which returns a value of type void * (i.e., a void pointer).
    - arg → argument to be passed to the function where the thread begins execution

- Thread completion
    - pthread_t is used to specify which thread to wait for.
    - a pointer to the return value you expect to get back
    - We can use NULL in the second argument to not care about the return value
    - In the case of passing a single value, we don’t have to package it up as an argument
    - we should note that one has to be extremely careful with how values are returned from a thread
        - never return a pointer which refers to something allocated on the thread’s call stack
    - procedure call
    - Long-lived programs may not need to join
- Locks
    - POSIX threads library are those for providing mutual exclusion to a critical section via locks
        - int pthread_mutex_lock(pthread_mutex_t *mutex);
        - int pthread_mutex_unlock(pthread_mutex_t *mutex);
    - Only one thread is holding the lock, waiting for thbe lock acquisition
    - Lack of proper initialization
        - pthread_mutex_t lock = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;
        - int rc = pthread_mutex_init(&lock, NULL);
        - assert(rc == 0);
    - If your code doesn’t properly check error codes, the failure will happen silently, which in this case could allow multiple threads into a critical section.
- Condition Variables
    - Condition variables are useful when some kind of signaling must take place between threads
    - int pthread_cond_wait(pthread_cond_t *cond, pthread_mutex_t *mutex);
    - int pthread_cond_signal(pthread_cond_t *cond);
    - First, when signaling (as well as when modifying the global variable ready), we always make sure to have the lock held.
    - wait call takes a lock as its second parameter, to release the lock when putting caller to sleep
    - the waiting thread re-checks the condition in a while loop, instead of a simple if statement.
